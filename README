A handful of AppleScript scripts I wrote while working for
MyPhotoAlbum.com from 2004-2010.

Notable is "send screencap to torque," which I used to share screen
captures with coworkers; after doing Command-Shift-4 and copying part
of a screen or a window, I would run this script to rename the file,
scp it to a server, and put the URL to the image in the Clipboard. I
could share an image with a coworker in a few seconds.

The other scripts might not work but contain the kernels of ideas.
